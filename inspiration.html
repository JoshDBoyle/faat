            <i>From Hyman G. Rickover's "Thoughts on Man's Purpose
              in Life," the Council on Religion & International Affairs'
              annual Morgenthau Memorial Lecture in 1982, after his
              retirement as a U.S. Navy admiral:</i><br>
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man's work begins
            with his job; his profession. Having a vocation is something
            of a miracle, like falling in love. I can understand why
            Luther said that a man is justified by his vocation, for it
            is proof of God's favor. But having a vocation means more
            than punching a time clock. It means guarding against
            banality, ineptitude, incompetence, and mediocrity. A man
            should strive to become a locus of excellence....<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man has a large capacity for
            effort. In fact it is so much greater than we think it is
            that few ever reach this capacity.<br> We should value
            the faculty of knowing what we ought to do and having the
            will to do it. Knowing is easy; it is the doing that is
            difficult. The critical issue is not what we know, but what
            we do with what we know. The great end of life is not
            knowledge, but action....<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To seek and accept
            responsibility, to persevere, to be committed to excellence,
            to be creative and courageous, to be unrelenting in the
            pursuit of intellectual development, to maintain high
            standards of ethics and moality, and to bring these basic
            principles of existence to bear through active participation
            in life - these are some of my ideas on goals that must be
            met to achieve meaning and purpose in life.

            <i>"No flying machine will ever fly from New York to
              Paris [because] no known motor can run at the requisite
              speed for four days without stopping."</i>

            <i>"If my father had not been the kind who encouraged
              his children to pursue intellectual interests without any
              thought of profit, our early curiosity about flying would
              have been nipped too early to bear fruit."</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>"The exhiliaration of flying is too keen, the
              pleasure too great, for it to be neglected as a sport."</i>

          <p>

              manufacturers in an endeavor to secure a motor for the new
              machine. Not receiving favorable answers from any of these
              we proceeded to design a motor of our own..."</i>

              aroused curiosity."</i>
