				The Foundation for Applied Aviation Technology, Inc. (FAAT) was founded by a group of supply chain 
				managers and engineers who know they can make a difference in aviation. 
				
				First, the founding Group recognized the disconnect between the knowledge acquired by engineering 
				students in the academic setting and the practical knowledge needed to be effective in the 
				design/manufacturing environment. Presently, academia attempts to provide practical experience 
				through (1) coop and/or intern programs for students and (2) competitive participation programs with 
				other Universities. The Group knows that more can be done to assist engineering students in the 
				transition between knowledge acquisition and knowledge application by establishing Airframe & 
				Powerplant (A&P) licensing programs.
				
				An A&P license is recognition of having acquired the practical knowledge for aircraft maintenance. The 
				Group wants to establish A&P licensing programs for engineering students at Universities as a credential 
				to be acquired through qualified training programs. An A&P License is the penultimate credential in the 
				aerospace engineering field (the Designated Engineering Representative [DER] is the ultimate).
				
				Second, the founding Group recognized that certain technologies are not being utilized in the General 
				Aviation (GA) market because of institutional limitations. In most cases, unless there is a patent or 
				controlled proprietary process involved in the advancement of a technology, the development funding 
				from the venture capital market would not be forthcoming. This is understandable since the venture 
				capital’s investment cannot be protected for maximum duration if there is no patent or protected 
				proprietary process.  What this means for certain technologies is that they won’t get developed or 
				implemented even though such advancements would add to the safety, efficiency, positive 
				environmental impact of aircraft systems. 
				
				Furthermore, it appears as though advancements in aircraft systems are extremely slow to develop 
				because of the associated perceived risks to the corporate sponsors. As in other industries, major 
				advancements in technology were not made by the “main stream” corporate players, but were 
				accomplished by the smaller, innovative, outside firms.
				
				In light of the above stated institutional limitations, the founding Group will fund the advancement of 
				General Aviation technologies on a “per project” basis.
				
				Ultimately, the founding group’s objective is to combine the development of technology function with 
				the education function thereby allowing engineering students to participate in the process of 
				transferring the practical technology to aviation.
